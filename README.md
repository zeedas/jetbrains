## Configuring

WakaTime for Jetbrains IDE's can be configured via Tools -> WakaTime Settings.

For more settings, WakaTime plugins share a common config file `.wakatime.cfg` located in your user home directory with [these options](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-cli/blob/develop/USAGE.md) available.


## Uninstalling

Inside your IDE, select `Preferences` -> `Plugins`, then find the `WakaTime` plugin. Click `Uninstall`. Then delete your `~/.wakatime.cfg` config file.


## Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re using a proxy, try excluding `*.wakatime.com` from using your IDE proxy:

![jetbrains proxy settings](https://wakatime.com/static/img/ScreenShots/jetbrains-no-proxy-setting.png?v=1)

Next, turn on debug mode from File -> WakaTime Settings. Then restart your IDE.

Now, look for WakaTime related messages in your `idea.log` file:

`Help` -> `Show Log` ( [Locating your idea.log file](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207241085-Locating-IDE-log-files) )

If the plugin was not loaded, you won't have a WakaTime Settings menu.
In that case, add this line to your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file:

    debug = true

(`C:\Users\<user>\.wakatime.cfg` on Windows)
